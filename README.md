# my-azure-sites
A place for me to 'write/design/test' sites run from: azure.microsoft.com

## Explanation...

It's possible to create/store either individual web pages/or else, entire web sites on GitHub;  
then, run those pages 'live' using:  
http://azure.microsoft.com  
...cloud web server technology;  
which allows you to both 'start'/'stop' the server running.  

*NOTE*: If you leave the server running, constantly; then, it's likely you will be charged money;   
therefore, once you've hit 'start'...remember to hit 'stop', afterwards...when finished testing.
