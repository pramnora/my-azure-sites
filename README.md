# my-azure-sites
A place for me to 'write/design/test' individual web pages/or, web sites being run from: azure.microsoft.com

## Explanation...

It's possible to store on GitHub either...

- individual web pages
- entire web sites

...then, run those pages 'live' using:  
http://azure.microsoft.com  
...cloud web server technology;  which allows you to both 'start'/'stop' the server running.  

*NOTE(1)*: If you leave the server running, constantly; then, it's likely you will be charged money;   
therefore, once you've hit 'start'...remember to hit 'stop', afterwards...whenever done testing. 

*NOTE(2)*: Individual web sites are served using: 001 (as the [index.html] web page will be served up, automatically);  
           individual web pages are served using their full filename/plus, filename extension: 001.html
